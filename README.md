6. Click "New Label" to create a label: label name: `priority: low`, description: `Severity level: 4` with color: blue.

You can refer [the color code](https://html-color-codes.info/).

7. Set the labels priority: urgent/important/low, optionally middle to the necessary issue tickets seeing all the opened tickets on the ChRIS_ultron_backEnd repository. No priority label ticket is okay.

8. After operating the labels on only ChRIS_ultron_backEnd repository for a while, then we can expand the labels to other important repositories.
